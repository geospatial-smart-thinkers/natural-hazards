These tectonic plates are massive sections of the Earth's crust that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. They constantly shift and interact due to the heat generated from the Earth's core, causing earthquakes and other geological phenomena.\n                        </p>\n\n                        <p>\n                            Earthquakes are a natural phenomenon that can occur in various parts of the world, including India. India is located in a seismically active region due to its position near the boundary of the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. This tectonic activity leads to the occurrence of earthquakes in the country.\n                        </p>\n\n\n                    </div>\n\n\n\n\n                </div>\n                <div className='col-md-5'>\n                    <div className='detail_content_page'>\n                        <img src={Img} alt='drought-img' />\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n\n\n                <div className='detail_content_page'>\n                    <h4> Earthquakes in India</h4>\n                    <p>Over the years, India has experienced a range of seismic events, both minor tremors and significant quakes that have left a lasting impact. The Himalayan region, the Indo-Gangetic plains, and parts of the northeastern states are particularly prone to seismic activity due to the collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Major historical earthquakes, like the devastating Bhuj earthquake in 2001, serve as stark reminders of the potential destruction that earthquakes can bring. <br />\n                        The government, in collaboration with organizations such as the Geological Survey of India, has taken steps to enhance seismic monitoring, disaster preparedness, and building codes to mitigate the risks associated with earthquakes. As India continues to develop and grow, understanding and respecting its seismic vulnerability remain crucial for building a safer and more resilient future.\n                    </p>\n                    <h4>Earthquake Risk Zones in India</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        The National Geophysical Laboratory, the Geological Survey of India, the Department of Meteorology under the Government of India, and the newly established National Institute of Disaster Management conducted an in-depth analysis of over 1,200 earthquakes that have occurred in various years across India's history. Based on this analysis, they categorized India into five distinct earthquake zones:\n                        <ol>\n                            <li>Zone of Very High Damage Risk</li>\n                            <li>Zone of High Damage Risk</li>\n                            <li>Zone of Moderate Damage Risk</li>\n                            <li>Zone of Low Damage Risk</li>\n                            <li>Zone of Very Low Damage Risk</li>\n                        </ol>\n\n                    </p>\n                    <h4> Why does India experience earthquakes?</h4>\n                    <p>\n\n                        India experiences earthquakes due to its geological position and the movement of tectonic plates. The Indian Plate, on which the country sits, is in motion, moving about 5 cm per year in a northeastern direction in a clockwise manner. In contrast, the Eurasian Plate, which is adjacent to the Indian Plate, is moving northward at a rate of 3 cm per year. This movement has resulted in the formation of the Himalayas, a young and highly active mountain range that continues to shape the landscape.\n                        The ongoing convergence of the Indian and Eurasian plates has led to the development of the Himalayas and surrounding areas. This process generates stress along fault lines due to the plates' interactions. As this stress accumulates over time, it creates a buildup of potential energy that can be released suddenly in the form of an earthquake.<br />\n                        The regions at the highest risk of earthquakes in India are those where these tectonic interactions are most intense. This includes the hill states, sections of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and even Delhi, all categorized under seismic Zone IV, indicating a significant seismic risk. The proximity and interconnectedness of tectonic plates spanning across Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, and India contribute to this heightened risk.<br />\n                        The Northeastern region, along with adjacent hill states, falls under the most severe seismic risk category, Zone V. Here, the geological forces are particularly strong, making this area susceptible to more powerful earthquakes. Overall, India's susceptibility to earthquakes is rooted in its geological setting, where the ongoing movement and interactions of tectonic plates continue to shape its landscape and generate seismic activity.\n\n                    </p>\n\n                    <h4>Types of Earthquakes</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES: Earthquakes can be classified into two main categories:\n                    </p>\n                    <ol>\n                        <li><strong>NATURALLY OCCURRING EARTHQUAKES:  </strong>There exist various natural causes behind earthquakes, including volcanic eruptions, isostatic adjustments, movements of tectonic plates, and the expansion and contraction of gases within the Earth's interior.</li>\n                        <li><strong>MAN-MADE EARTHQUAKES:  </strong>Human activities contribute significantly to disasters on Earth.

When earthquakes strike, they can inflict devastating effects, leading to loss of life, displacement of populations, and destruction of infrastructure. Beyond the immediate human toll, earthquakes can trigger environmental repercussions such as landslides, soil liquefaction, and even tsunamis in coastal areas. <br />\n                        These events disrupt ecosystems, contaminate water sources, and alter landscapes. As societies strive to recover, they face the daunting task of rebuilding homes, revitalizing economies, and restoring ecosystems, often necessitating interdisciplinary efforts to address the intricate interplay between human and environmental vulnerabilities.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <h4>Earthquake hazard mitigation</h4>\n\n                    <ul>\n                        <li><strong>Building Resilience: </strong>Implementing stringent building codes and designing structures to withstand seismic forces, along with retrofitting existing buildings to modern standards.</li>\n                        <li><strong>Community Preparedness:</strong> Educating the public about earthquake risks, encouraging community-based disaster planning, and conducting drills to ensure effective emergency responses.</li>\n                        <li><strong>Infrastructure Safeguarding: </strong>Designing critical infrastructure resilient to earthquakes, such as hospitals and power plants, and deploying advanced seismic monitoring for early warnings.</li>\n                        <li><strong>Policy and Collaboration: </strong>Developing policies that promote safe construction practices, fostering international cooperation to share expertise, and advancing research to enhance understanding and mitigation strategies.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    <h4>Earthquake Stations in India</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        Earthquake monitoring and data collection in India are carried out by various organizations and agencies.
