A tropical cyclone, also known as a hurricane or typhoon depending on location, has winds below 74 miles per hour. As it intensifies, becoming a severe cyclone, its winds range from 75 to 120 miles per hour. Once winds exceed 120 miles per hour, it becomes a super cyclone.\n\n\n                        </p>\n\n                        <p>\n                            Cyclones are characterized by air rotation and form when atmospheric pressure is low over warm water exceeding 26.5°C.

These effects can range from strong winds and heavy rainfall to storm surges and flooding, causing both immediate damage and long-term impacts. Here are some of the effects of tropical cyclones on India:\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>Strong Winds: Cyclones are characterized by powerful winds that can cause extensive damage to infrastructure, buildings, trees, and power lines. These winds can lead to the collapse of weak structures and disrupt essential services.</li>\n                        <li>Heavy Rainfall: Cyclones often bring heavy and intense rainfall, which can lead to widespread flooding. This flooding can damage homes, agriculture, and transportation infrastructure, and also result in landslides in hilly and mountainous regions.</li>\n                        <li>Storm Surges: A significant impact of cyclones is the storm surge—a rise in sea level that occurs during a cyclone's landfall. Storm surges can inundate coastal areas, causing extensive damage and loss of life. Coastal communities and ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to storm surges.</li>\n                        <li>Flooding: The heavy rainfall associated with cyclones can lead to river and urban flooding. Floodwaters can disrupt transportation, damage crops, contaminate water sources, and displace communities.</li>\n                        <li>Infrastructure Damage: Cyclones can cause substantial damage to infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, and airports. This can hinder relief and recovery efforts and disrupt economic activities.</li>\n                        <li>Displacement and Loss of Life: Cyclones can lead to the displacement of communities, particularly in low-lying and vulnerable areas. Loss of life can occur due to drowning, building collapses, and other direct and indirect impacts.</li>\n                        <li>Agricultural Impact: Cyclones can damage crops and agricultural lands, leading to reduced yields and economic losses for farmers. This can also impact food availability and prices.</li>\n                        <li>Health Concerns: Floodwaters can lead to waterborne diseases due to contamination of water sources. Crowded evacuation centers can also contribute to the spread of communicable diseases.\n                        </li>\n                        <li>Economic Loss: The combined impact of damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and other economic activities can result in significant economic losses for the affected regions and the country as a whole.\n                        </li>\n                        <li>Long-Term Effects: Communities and regions affected by cyclones often require long-term recovery and reconstruction efforts. Rebuilding infrastructure, restoring livelihoods, and addressing psychological and social impacts are essential aspects of recovery.</li>\n                    </ol>\n\n                    <h4>Cyclone prone districts in India</h4>\n                    <p>India has several cyclone-prone districts located along its coastal regions, primarily along the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. These districts are more susceptible to the impacts of tropical cyclones, including strong winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and flooding. Here are some of the cyclone-prone districts in India:</p>\n\n\n                    <p>Bay of Bengal Coast:</p>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Odisha: Coastal districts like Puri, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, and Bhadrak are highly cyclone-prone due to their exposure to the Bay of Bengal.</li>\n                        <li>Andhra Pradesh: The districts of Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam, and East Godavari are vulnerable to cyclones.</li>\n                        <li>West Bengal: Coastal districts including North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas are prone to cyclone impacts.</li>\n                        <li>Tamil Nadu: Coastal districts like Chennai, Nagapattinam, and Cuddalore are also exposed to cyclone risks.</li>\n                    </ul>\n\n                    <p>Arabian Sea Coast:</p>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Gujarat: The Kutch region and districts like Bharuch and Surat along the Gujarat coastline are prone to cyclones originating in the Arabian Sea.</li>\n                        <li>Maharashtra: Coastal districts such as Mumbai, Raigad, and Ratnagiri face cyclone risks.</li>\n                        <li>Kerala: The districts of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, and Alappuzha are located along the Arabian Sea coast and are vulnerable to cyclones.</li>\n                        <li>Karnataka: Coastal districts like Uttara Kannada and Dakshina Kannada can also be affected by cyclones.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                    These districts have historically experienced the impacts of tropical cyclones due to their geographical locations.\n                    <h4>Cyclones impacted in recent years</h4>\n                    Tropical cyclones that have made landfall or impacted different coastal regions of India in recent years. Here's a brief overview of some of these cyclones:\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>Amphan (2020): Cyclone Amphan was one of the strongest cyclones ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal.
