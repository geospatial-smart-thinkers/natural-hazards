            Drought is a natural phenomenon characterized by an extended period of water scarcity in an area. It results from inadequate rainfall, excessive evaporation, and over utilization of water from various sources such as reservoirs and groundwater. Droughts can have a devastating impact on people, animals, and the environment. They can also lead to social unrest and conflict.</p>\n\n                    <p>\n                        The length of a drought can vary greatly. Some droughts may only last a few weeks, while others can persist for years. The most severe droughts can last for decades.</p>\n\n\n                    <h4>Drought in India</h4>\n                    <p>The Indian economy relies heavily on agriculture, providing livelihoods for over 70% of the population, either directly or indirectly. The irregularities in monsoon patterns, such as delayed onset, extended breaks, and early withdrawal, lead to frequent droughts across various regions of India. A significant portion of India, around two-thirds, receives inadequate rainfall (less than 1000 mm), which is also unevenly distributed.</p>\n\n                    <p>Out of the total cultivated land area of 140 million hectares, approximately 68% is susceptible to drought conditions. Almost every year, certain regions in India encounter localized droughts.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                </div>\n                <div className='col-md-5'>\n                <div

different types in terms of impact:</p>\n                    <ol>\n                        <li><strong>Meteorological Drought:</strong> This type of drought occurs when there is a prolonged period of insufficient rainfall, often accompanied by uneven distribution over time and space.</li>\n                        <li><strong>Agricultural Drought:</strong> This type of drought occurs when there are low soil moisture levels necessary to support crops, leading to crop loss.</li>\n                        <li><strong>Hydrological Drought:</strong> This type of drought occurs when water availability in reservoirs, aquifers, lakes, and other storage systems falls below levels that can be replenished by rainfall.</li>\n                    </ol>\n\n                    <h4>Factor affecting Drought</h4>\n                    <p>The causes of drought are complex and can be influenced by various natural and human-induced factors. Here are some of the key factors affecting drought:</p>\n\n                    <ul>\n\n                        <li><strong>Rainfall Deficiency:</strong> Insufficient rainfall is the primary factor leading to drought. When an area receives significantly less rainfall than usual over an extended period, it can result in water shortages and dry conditions.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>High Temperatures:</strong> Elevated temperatures can cause increased evaporation rates, leading to faster drying of soil, water bodies, and vegetation. Hotter conditions can exacerbate the impacts of low rainfall.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Climate Variability and Change:</strong> Natural climate variability, as well as long-term changes in climate patterns, can influence drought occurrence. Climate change can alter precipitation patterns, making some regions more susceptible to drought.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Soil Conditions:</strong> The type of soil and its moisture-holding capacity play a role in drought susceptibility. Poor soil moisture retention can lead to quicker drying during dry periods.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Water Management Practices:</strong> Mismanagement of water resources, inefficient irrigation practices, and over-extraction of groundwater can contribute to water scarcity and drought conditions.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Clearing forests reduces the capacity of an area to retain moisture and can disrupt local rainfall patterns, potentially leading to drought.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> Urban development can increase the demand for water while reducing natural areas that can absorb rainwater, increasing the risk of drought in urban areas.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Land Use Changes:</strong> Converting natural landscapes into agricultural fields or urban areas can alter local climate conditions and impact water availability, potentially leading to drought.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Contamination of water sources can limit their usability for agriculture and other purposes, exacerbating water scarcity during droughts.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Population Growth:</strong> A growing population demands more water for various needs, putting additional stress on already limited water resources during drought periods.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Deficient Water Infrastructure:</strong> Lack of proper water storage, distribution, and management systems can magnify the impacts of drought by reducing the ability to store and utilize water efficiently.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Natural Disasters:</strong> Events such as wildfires and volcanic eruptions can alter landscapes and impact precipitation patterns, contributing to drought conditions.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>El Niño and La Niña:</strong> These climate phenomena, characterized by warmer or cooler ocean temperatures in the Pacific, can disrupt global weather patterns and influence drought occurrence.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Global Climate Change:</strong> Changes in atmospheric conditions due to greenhouse gas emissions can lead to shifts in rainfall patterns and intensify the frequency and severity of droughts.</li>\n\n                    </ul>\n\n                    <h4>Drought Prone Areas in India</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        \"Drought-prone areas\" refers to regions or locations that are particularly susceptible to experiencing drought conditions. These areas have a higher likelihood of facing recurring or prolonged periods of water scarcity due to factors such as low and erratic rainfall, arid or semi-arid climates, and limited water resources.</p>\n\n                    <p>Numerous administrative districts across different Indian states have endured persistent drought conditions.
