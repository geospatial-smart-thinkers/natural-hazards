Among these, three notable diseases are Malaria, Dengue, and Anaemia.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <h4>Malaria:</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by parasites of the Plasmodium genus. It remains a major health concern in various parts of India, particularly in regions with warm and humid climates. The disease is transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue. If left untreated, it can lead to severe complications and even death. Efforts to control and prevent malaria in India involve mosquito control measures, the use of bed nets, and timely diagnosis and treatment.\n                        India carries 1.7% of the global malaria case burden, 1.2% of global malarial deaths and 85.2% of malaria burden in South East Asia. In 2022 in India, there were over 45 thousand reported cases of malaria. In 2021, however, the number of cases were higher with over 160 thousand cases.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>Malaria is a mosquito borne infectious disease, so the precautions taken to eradicate it are:\n                        <ol>\n                            <li>Spraying the insecticides to kill the mosquitoes</li>\n                            <li>Preventing the stagnation of water, which acts as a breeding ground for the mosquitoes </li>\n                            <li>Using the mosquito nets to protect ourselves from them.</li>\n                        </ol>\n                    </p>\n\n\n                    <h4>Dengue:</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        Dengue fever is another mosquito-borne illness prevalent in India. It is caused by the dengue virus, which is transmitted primarily by the Aedes mosquito. Dengue fever is characterized by high fever, severe joint and muscle pain, rash, and in some cases, bleeding. In severe cases, it can progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which can be life-threatening.\n                        This epidemic is mostly likely to be seen in the months of July, August, September in India. It has been reported that from 2020-2022, the cases have been increased by 1.88lakh, from 44,585 in 2020 to 2,33,251 in 2022.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>Dengue is also one such disease, that is mosquito-borne, which can be eliminated by taking preventive measures such as,\n                        <ol>\n                            <li>Keeping the house and surroundings neat, clean and tidy.</li>\n                            <li>In the rains, the chances of getting affected with dengue are high due to the increased level of the fresh stagnant water, so that has to be taken care of.</li>\n                            <li>Wearing clothes that don’t leave much of the skin exposed.</li>\n                            <li>The wet garbage has to be separated from the dry ones and has to be disposed separately.</li>\n                        </ol>\n                    </p>\n\n\n                    <h4>Anaemia:</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        Anaemia is a condition characterized by a lower-than-normal level of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. It is a significant health issue in India, particularly among women and children. Anaemia can result from various factors, including nutritional deficiencies (such as iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid), chronic diseases, and certain genetic conditions. Symptoms of anaemia include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath. Addressing anaemia requires a multi-faceted approach, including improving nutrition, providing iron supplementation, and managing underlying health condition.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>India’s anaemia burden has grown alarmingly finding that 57% women in the age group of 15-49 and 67% children are anaemic. The main reasons for anaemia in India are issues like poverty, sanitation, caste issues. The four basic approaches to the prevention of iron deficiency anaemia are,</p>\n                    <ol>\n                        <li>Supplementation with medicinal iron</li>\n                        <li>Education and associated measures to increase dietary iron intake</li>\n                        <li>The control of infection</li>\n                        <li>The fortification of a staple food with iron</li>\n                    </ol>\n\n\n                    <h4>COVID-19 - The Global Pandemic</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is an infectious disease ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness and potentially fatal in severe cases. The name \"corona\" arises from the crown-like spikes on the virus's surface.\n                        Notable coronaviruses causing human illness include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the common cold. As a global pandemic affecting every country, these viruses can mutate during interspecies transmission.<br />\n                        The mode of entry for SARS-CoV-2 is through the mouth, nose, or eyes via direct contact or airborne droplets. Typical symptoms comprise fever, chills, headache, runny nose, sore throat, loss of taste/smell, and muscle/body aches.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>However, it has been observed that a few infected people didn’t show any of these symptoms.
