It happens when there is a buildup of electrical potential difference between the ground and the atmosphere, typically within a thundercloud or between different clouds. This electrical potential difference can be caused by the separation of positive and negative charges within these clouds.\n                        </p>\n\n                        <p>\n                            Lightning is a dangerous and unpredictable phenomenon.
